Ideas tried by the agents improving this repository, newest first, including the ones that
did not work, so later runs don't repeat them. One entry per idea: date, idea, result.

## 2026-11-12 - initial compiler (PR #1)

- Idea: drop zero weights; one LUT per neuron with fan-in <= k; otherwise per-chunk partial
  sums, LUT ripple-carry adder tree and sign test; structural hashing, constant folding, sweep.
- Result: total 43,424 LUTs over the suite, worst depth 31; 50-88% fewer LUTs than the dense
  baseline depending on sparsity.
